      <h1>Momrev's Jamaican Banana Bread</h1>

      <h2 id="story">Before there were Facebook walls...</h2>

      <p>There were walls in restaurants in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, where my mother was vacationing in 1992. She found this recipe written there, brought it home, and made it probably hundreds of times in the course of my childhood. I still throw it together every time I have two overripe bananas kicking around. Easy and delightful.</p><br>

      <figcaption><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_bread">Wikipedia</a> tells me that National Banana Bread Day is February 25th.</figcaption>


      <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mash bananas and soda with a fork.</li>
        <li> Add sugar, oil, and egg, and stir well. Add flour and a few shakes of cinnamon.</li>
        <li> Grease a loaf pan (with butter, vegetable oil or spray oil like Pam) and pour in the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 45 minutes at 350F. Watch the cake near the end of the baking time so the top of the cake does not get too dark.</li>
